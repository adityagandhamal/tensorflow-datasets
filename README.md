In this project, I have given an introduction to how to make use of the datasets provided by TensorFlow itself.
I have shown the following steps in the jupyter notebook(tfds.ipynb):
  - How to import the package
  - Find Available Datasets
  - How to get info about a particular dataset
  - And how to load the dataset
  
  For indepth information and guidelines, please visit [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview)
